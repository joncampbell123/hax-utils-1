This is the master collection of Jonathan's HAX utilities,
revision 1. This is where ALL development goes, even experimental
stuff.

This code by design primarily targets Linux, but code will eventually
have makefiles and support for compiling under other compilers and
targets:

  Microsoft Visual Studio 2008
     -> 32-bit or 64-bit Windows

  Open Watcom
     -> 16-bit & 32-bit DOS
     -> 16-bit & 32-bit Windows
     -> 16-bit & 32-bit OS/2

This code does not have a vast centralized makefile system or use
autoconf to tie everything together. Over time a framework will be
built. Until then, support for multiple compilers/platforms will
be ad-hoc.
