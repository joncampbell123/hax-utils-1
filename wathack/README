Watcom compiler + linker hacking tests


test1               - Reference EXE (MS-DOS program that prints "hello world")
test2               - Inserting arbitrary data into the program
test3               - Inserting arbitrary data into the program
test4               - Mixing 16-bit realmode (C) and 32-bit protected mode (ASM) using BITS 32
test5               - Mixing 16-bit realmode (C) and 32-bit protected mode (ASM) using USE32
test6               - Mixing 16-bit realmode (C) and 32-bit protected mode (C). Yeah, ick :)
test7               - Reference EXE (32-bit MS-DOS program)
test8               - Inserting arbitrary data into the program
test9               - Mixing 16-bit realmode (C) and 32-bit protected mode (ASM) using USE16
test10              - Mixing 16-bit realmode (C) and 32-bit protected mode (C), target 32-bit. Yeah, ick :)
		      (and yet, Watcom's linker has no problem sticking 16-bit code into a 32-bit EXE)
test11              - Mixing 16-bit realmode (C) and 32-bit protected mode (C), target 32-bit.
                      This time the 16-bit code calls another 16-bit code, to test whether relocations are
                      done correctly.

test12              - Mixing 32-bit C (Watcom) and 32-bit C (GCC i386) functions and objects.
                      Includes proof of concept Watcom C calling a GCC compiled function.
test13              - Same as test12, testing that Watcom is able to pass parameters to GCC
                      functions.
